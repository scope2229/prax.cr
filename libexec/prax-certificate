# Usage: prax certificate [action]
# Summary: Self-sign SSL certificates
# Help: This command will generate or clear an SSL certificate
#
# By default the action is to generate the SSL certificates. Once generated you
# may restart Prax and it will run a HTTPS server along the HTTP server. This
# may prove useful in some cases â€”like interacting with Facebook.
#
# Certificates are valid for one year, so you'll may have to regenerate them
# with "prax certificate".
#
# If you dont want the SSL server anymore, run "prax certificate clear" then
# restart Prax. The HTTPS server will no longer be started.
